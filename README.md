## react-native-web (RNW)

So much cool, you can build rect-native and react web in the same code base, using react-native component as default. RNW will translate your react-native code to dom out of the box. But still, there are some drawbacks that you have to get, for example:

- react-navigation is collaborated with RNW, navigation work fine for simple routing, but you cannot use native feature like back with gesture, in scroll position after back from stack screen, no path for stack nav, etc.

- You must do tricky way to handle responsiveness of screen in website case. as you know, if you use general dom, media-query is so easy.

## Infinite scroll using react-query

Using react-query we can use `useInfiniteQuery`. It's very handy use, similar like common `useQuery` but data is provider grouped by page/cursor. Somehow in `react-native-web`, `FlatList` component has some glitch in `onEndReached` functionality. the workaround is we need to listen window scroll height and position. In this project I use my custom hooks `useScrollTreshold`.

## Pokeapi

This API is so much "fun" üòú. To get list of pokemon and the details you need to call API several times. So, we have to decide a good way to provide data in our app. For example.

### How to get pokemon detail list

Fetch pokemon list, and surprisingly, you will only get `name` as real value, for the rest of data you need to fetch the detail to another endpoint. let say if we will load 20 pokemon data, so you will hit api 21 in total. 1 for the list and 20 for the details.

### Get pokemon list with filet type

Filter pokemon list based on their type. And... I'm didn't found how to filter using `type` query params. 
There is another way, you can hit `/type/<type_name>`, but.. you will get pokemon data as a total (not paginated). So, as far as I can filtering data based on type is done in front end it self (you can see in `useGetPokeList.ts` file).
Maybe, pokeapi should create something like this `/pokemon?type=dragon` üòÅ.
